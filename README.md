# Better-ENG-Localization-FFVIIR2
Using LLM's to translate Japanese to English for a better localization to the English language

These files are useless on their own and will not package nicely into the game assets. They are only here as an open-sourced effort to improve, refine, and fix the translations.

I feel enough information should be here to cross reference. The file is split into four columns: `id,name,text,text_jp`

`id`: This is the id of the subtitle\
`name`: this is the name of the actor that is speaking\
`text`: this is the English translation\
`text_jp`: this is the original japanese text

The files have been sorted by `id` so they should be what appears in order of how the game with display them (for main quests at least).
