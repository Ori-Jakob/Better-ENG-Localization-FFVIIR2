$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_5800_00_mma,,I wanna be a honeybee!<br>A gorgeous honeybee!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_5900_00_mmk,,"When I grow up,<br>I’m gonna be a Shinra SOLDIER!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_5910_00_mmk,,That’s why<br>I’m training hard now!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_6000_00_mfk,,Big bro’s so childish—<br>I’m embarrassed!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_6300_00_mfa,,"Clean air, endless sky—<br>no plates, just pure freedom!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_6400_00_mfa,,"If I’m here, I might just forget<br>about that nasty breakup with my boyfriend."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_6500_00_mfa,,"Yeah, yeah, that jerk."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_6510_00_mfa,,No way he’d dump me too!<br>Honestly!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_6600_00_mfa,,Huh? You went out with him too?<br>I’ve never heard that before!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_6700_00_mfa,,"Oops, that was supposed to be a secret."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_6800_00_mma,,"The other day, I got lost<br>and ended up at the lookout tower."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_6810_00_mma,,Got chased by some bandit-looking guys.<br>It was a real mess!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_6900_00_mfa,,"Still as directionally challenged as ever, huh?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7000_00_mfa,,"Last time you tried going to the farm,<br>you ended up at the docks<br>and got chased by monsters, didn’t you?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7100_00_mma,,"Yeah, I get distracted watching the birds<br>and end up in weird places."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7200_00_mma,,"‘I am Count Kylegate!<br> Behold this proud, towering wall!’"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7300_00_mma,,"‘Oh, the future of Calm is blessed indeed!’"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7400_00_mma,,"No, that’s not quite it."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7410_00_mma,,Gotta write something better<br>for the Calm Theater Troupe.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7500_00_mmk,,"Morning! Once everyone’s here,<br>what’re we doing today?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7600_00_mmk,,"We played ‘Chase the Rat’ yesterday,<br>so we decided on ‘Tickle the Ogre’ today,<br>remember?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7700_00_mfk,,"Yeah, yeah!<br>We gotta pick the ogre once we’re all here!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7800_00_mfa,,"There was an event in Midgar this weekend,<br>but now it’s locked down."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7810_00_mfa,,The Materia Ice eating contest—<br>I was gonna dominate it this time!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7900_00_mfa,,"If it’s next week, they’ll have the limited Titan Ice.<br>Maybe waiting’s not so Burke?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8000_00_mfa,,That one’s so huge it fills you up—<br>ruins your shot at mastering all the Materia Ice.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8100_00_mfa,,"Hey, have you read<br>the new ‘Cactus King’ from Moogle Bookstore?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8200_00_mma,,No way! There’s a new ‘Cactus King’ out?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8210_00_mma,,"Wait, wait—<br>what happens to Saborn VII?!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8300_00_mfa,,"I’ll lend it to you, so read it!<br>Oh—no spoilers to anyone, got it?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8400_00_mma,,My son’s working in Midgar.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8410_00_mma,,"We had a falling out,<br>but I hear he’s made it big as a pro singer."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8600_00_mfa,,Finally snagged a copy<br>of ‘Monthly Mysteric’~!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8610_00_mfa,,Look at this!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8700_00_mfa,,Tanks and windmills from the Republic era—<br>all beautifully laid out!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8800_00_mma,,You really enjoy looking at ruin photo collections?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8900_00_mma,,"‘Weekly Chocoboy’ has<br>Chocobo gravure idols, you know!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_9000_00_mfa,,That’s fine by me~
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_9010_00_mfa,,I’d rather have old stuff with history<br>than cute things.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_9100_00_mfa,,"Sigh, I wanna take<br>a trip to Cosmo Canyon someday~"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_10000_00_mma,,No time to doze off—<br>just endless work days.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_10010_00_mma,,"Well, I used to make<br>your monthly earnings in a single day."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_10100_00_mma,,"Whoa, jealous yet?<br>Want my business card, huh?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_10400_00_mma,,How’s the economy treating you?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_10410_00_mma,,Me? I handed my business to my son.<br>The hotel we’ve got in Costa’s doing great.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_10500_00_mma,,"Oh, that’s swell!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_10510_00_mma,,I’m thinking of investing<br>in some Chocobo racing myself.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_10600_00_mma,,"Hmm, if you’re into Chocobo fun,<br>buying a whole farm might be cheaper."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_12200_00_mfa,,Treats made with local cherries<br>and chocolate!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_12210_00_mfa,,"Go ahead, have a taste!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_12300_00_mfa,,There’s a Midgar-style version too!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_12310_00_mfa,,Super sweet syrup—<br>but zero calories!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_12400_00_mma,,How about some mysterious coffee<br>made by a Chocobo?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_12500_00_mma,,A lovely moment<br>with mysterious Chocobo coffee.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_12600_00_mma,,Heard the rumors<br>about Chocobo coffee?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_12700_00_mfa,,Huh? What’s that?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_12800_00_mma,,They say it’s made by having Chocobos<br>chew Saraha nuts.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_12900_00_mfa,,"Wait, you mean…<br>Ew, I can’t drink that anymore!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_13000_00_mfa,,Finally got in~<br>It’s so crowded today!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_13100_00_mma,,"Even on a day like this,"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_13110_00_mma,,they say confessing up on this tower<br>guarantees a happy marriage.<br>That tale never changes.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_13200_00_mfa,,"Whoa, not me!<br>No confessions here!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_13300_00_mma,,Calm kokeshi dolls!<br>Anyone want a Calm kokeshi~?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_13400_00_mma,,A folk craft made from Grasslands’<br>natural wood—guaranteed love success!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_13500_00_mma,,"Good fortune, matchmaking, family safety—<br>the blessings are real!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_13510_00_mma,,Calm kokeshi dolls!<br>Grab one as a souvenir!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_13800_00_mfa,,"Sounds like Midgar’s in a mess.<br>Anti-Shinra Avalanche folks are stirring things up, right?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_13900_00_mfa,,Forget that—my neighbor’s mansion<br>keeps making weird noises at night!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_14000_00_mfa,,Maybe it’s a ghost?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_14100_00_mfa,,Oh my!<br>That’s way more interesting!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_14600_00_mfa,,How about some<br>Chocobo-flavored ice cream?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_14700_00_mfa,,Made with rich milk<br>straight from Grasslands farms~!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_14800_00_mfa,,I’ll toss in some Rasan berries too~!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_14900_00_mfa,,"Fluffy, melty cream<br>Moogle manjū!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_15000_00_mfa,,Even the pom-pom’s<br>loaded with cream~!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_15100_00_mfa,,Eat together and find happiness—<br>how about a Moogle manjū~?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_4500_00_mma,,How much is this?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_4600_00_mma,,"Guess I should<br>have stuff like this on hand, huh?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_5000_00_mfa,,"Ooh, this sword’s nice!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_5100_00_mfa,,"Ammo refills, maintenance oil—<br>better grab spares since it’s getting dicey."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_7700_00_mma,,Chocobo delivery package—<br>here you go!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_7800_00_mma,,Sorry for the wait!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_7900_00_mma,,"Mmm, looks good!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_8000_00_mma,,"Here, gimme a smile!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_8100_00_mma,,Awesome!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_8200_00_mma,,"Pretty nice, huh~"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_8300_00_mfa,,Hehehe!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_8400_00_mfa,,Hahaha
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_8500_00_mfa,,How’s this?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_8600_00_mfa,,So tiring~
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_8700_00_mma,,How about this one?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_8800_00_mma,,Hahaha!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_8900_00_mma,,"Cool, right?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_9000_00_mma,,"Alright, pose!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_9100_00_mfa,,Nice~ Lovely!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_9200_00_mfa,,How do you do it?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_9300_00_mfa,,Like this?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_9400_00_mfa,,"Oh, it’s blurry…"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_9500_00_mfa,,"Look, that’s the lookout tower!<br>You can see Midgar from up there."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_9600_00_mfk,,Wow~!<br>I wanna draw Midgar quick!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_9800_00_mma,,"Whoa, want my business card?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_9810_00_mma,,I used to work<br>in Shinra’s space development division.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_9900_00_mma,,Busy every day with rocket development.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_0100_00_mma,,Time to stock up on fresh ingredients~!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_0200_00_mma,,"Alright, what should I buy today?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_0300_00_mma,,"Uh, what’s today’s recommendation?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_0400_00_mma,,"Okay, got the veggies—<br>now for meat and cheese."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_0500_00_mma,,The market’s the best~<br>The smell of veggies is so refreshing!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_0600_00_mfa,,"Ifrit Oil’s on sale,<br>so I gotta go grab some!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_0700_00_mfa,,"Next, stocking up at that shop~"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_0800_00_mfa,,"Hmm, what should today’s salad be?"

$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_2800_00_mma,,"Heh heh heh, I’m just here to browse."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_3000_00_mfa,,I’d rather buy here<br>than from a vending machine.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_3100_00_mfa,,Maybe I should stock up on some Potions?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_4700_00_mfa,,Fresh Grasslands veggies!

$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_9200_00_mma,,Meat raised right here in the Grasslands!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_9300_00_mma,,How about a thick steak<br>for the family tonight?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_0100_00_mma,,"A walk really<br>calms the nerves, doesn’t it?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_0200_00_mma,,This peace is what Calm’s all about.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_0300_00_mma,,"Ahh, the breeze feels nice again today."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_0400_00_mma,,"No matter what’s happening out there,<br>I wanna believe Calm’s walls keep us safe."

$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_0600_00_mfa,,I love<br>the slow flow of time here.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_0700_00_mfa,,"Oh, you can smell the flowers from here today!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_0800_00_mfa,,Here’s to some wonderful encounters!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_0900_00_mfa,,Moving to Calm was the best decision ever~
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_1000_00_mfa,,I pray these peaceful days<br>keep going forever.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_2100_00_mma,,"Hmmm, hmhmm~"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_3800_00_mfa,,Broad from the inn doesn’t look so good.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_3900_00_mfa,,Heard he’s been under the weather lately.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4000_00_mfa,,"You were a fan of his, right?<br>Said his lonely smile was charming or something."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4100_00_mfa,,"Oh, keep that a secret from my husband!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4400_00_mma,,"So, how was the Midgar scene?<br>Did you hit up the Honeybee Inn like usual?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4500_00_mma,,"Man, what a stage!<br>That blonde dancer’s moves were razor-sharp."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4600_00_mma,,Ended up cross-dressing<br>and sneaking into Corneo’s mansion.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4610_00_mma,,Wonder what’s going on there now.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4619_00_mma,,Rumors say war might break out—<br>what’re we gonna do?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4620_00_mma,,Cancel the Honeybee Inn tour?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4621_00_mma,,"Nah, times like this<br>are when the girls give us strength!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4622_00_mma,,Hope that cross-dressing dancer’s<br>still around.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4700_00_mfa,,"Come on, make those pretty flowers bloom!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4800_00_mfa,,"Ahh, what a nice scent."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_5200_00_mma,,"Hmm, what’s up with those black cloaks?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_5300_00_mma,,Is Shinra’s dark side behind it?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_5400_00_mma,,I’m a writer<br>tracking the black cloaks.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_5500_00_mma,,"Most say they’re severe Mako poisoning cases,<br>but some think they’re victims<br>of special experiments."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_5600_00_mma,,Feels like there’s more secrets to uncover.<br>Gonna gather evidence and dig deeper.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_5700_00_mma,,Making an enemy of Shinra<br>could get messy.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6000_00_mma,,Fluffy manjū with sweet-and-spicy minced meat—<br>so good!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6100_00_mma,,Leaving Midgar’s a bummer<br>since I can’t grab Sector 8 manjū<br>whenever I want anymore.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6200_00_mma,,"Ahh, that manjū girl vendor—<br>my little manjū sweetheart!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6210_00_mma,,Wonder how she’s doing now.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6300_00_mfa,,"If we picked flowers from the hill overlooking Midgar<br>for this flowerbed,<br>it’d look even prettier, right?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6500_00_mfa,,"Red, blue, yellow all lined up—<br>with some green cat grass too!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6600_00_mfa,,It’d make a nice accent for sure!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_7000_00_mfa,,"Hey, heard about Broad from the inn?<br>They say he’s gone missing!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_7100_00_mfa,,He wasn’t feeling well—<br>maybe he went off to recover somewhere?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_7200_00_mfa,,"Aw, not seeing Broad’s smile anymore—<br>one of my little joys is gone."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0100_00_mma,,Got punched by a soldier.<br>This bruise is Avalanche’s fault!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0200_00_mma,,They say Calm’s Mako tank’s in trouble<br>’cause of the reactor explosion.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0300_00_mma,,Shinra’s army ain’t messin’ around—<br>they showed us what they’ve got!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0310_00_mma,,Rumors of war with Wutai<br>might actually come true.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0400_00_mma,,Midgar really got trashed—<br>that for real?!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0500_00_mma,,"Thanks to Avalanche,<br>life’s gonna get tougher for us too."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0600_00_mfa,,"If Calm stops getting Mako,<br>we’re done for!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0700_00_mfa,,Looks like Midgar’s<br>locked down for a while.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0800_00_mfa,,Getting hit by Shinra<br>before Avalanche even gets here!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0900_00_mfa,,War with Wutai—<br>could that really happen?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_10000_00_mfa,,Avalanche’s violence is a warning from the planet!<br>The tornado that kicked up is proof of its anger!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_1000_00_mfa,,The plate falling—<br>how many people got caught up in that?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_10100_00_mfa,,"Mako is the planet’s life. If it runs dry,<br>our lives will dry up too eventually."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_10200_00_mfa,,We mustn’t let the Lifestream fade!<br>May our lives be one with the planet!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_2100_00_mma,,Calm’s under strict alert right now.<br>Keep stops to the bare minimum!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_2200_00_mma,,Finish your business and get outta here!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_2500_00_mma,,Monster alert in effect—<br>high priority!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_2510_00_mma,,Airship noise<br>has the monsters all riled up!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_2600_00_mma,,Don’t get close and throw your life away!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_2900_00_mfa,,Getting nabbed by Shinra troops during a date—<br>worst day ever!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_3000_00_mma,,"But it got your heart racing, right?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_3100_00_mfa,,"Yeah, seeing you get punched was the best!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_3400_00_mma,,"Thanks, Avalanche—<br>you spiced up our date!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_7200_00_mma,,"Oh yeah, I saw some black cloaks<br>wandering the wastes<br>near Midgar’s gate."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_7300_00_mma,,They were moaning—<br>gave me the creeps!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_7400_00_mfa,,"Escaping Midgar, huh?<br>Tough nuts, like sewer rats!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_7500_00_mma,,"Haha, just like you guys!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_8300_00_mfa,,"Hey, hey,<br>what do Avalanche members look like?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_8400_00_mma,,No info.<br>Guess they don’t know much yet.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_8500_00_mfa,,How’re we supposed to find ‘em then?!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_8600_00_mma,,Just turn in anyone who looks shady—<br>that’s the plan!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_8700_00_mfa,,"Oh, got it—<br>should I report you then?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_8800_00_mma,,"Phew, that was a close one!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_8900_00_mma,,Nearly ran over some black cloaks<br>on my way to Calm!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_9000_00_mfa,,That was a close call!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_9100_00_mfa,,"Those guys are Mako addicts, right?<br>Did Midgar kick ‘em out or something?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_9200_00_mma,,They were walking in a group—<br>pretty rare around here!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_9800_00_mfa,,"People of the planet, hear its cries!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_9900_00_mfa,,"The planet mourns,<br>the planet sorrows,<br>the planet rages!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_0100_00_mma,,Avalanche is why the Mako’s drying up—<br>I’ll catch ‘em myself!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_0200_00_mma,,Shinra’s looking<br>pretty rattled these days.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_0300_00_mma,,"Avalanche or Shinra—<br>whoever wins, we’re not cashing in."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_0400_00_mma,,"If the Mako keeps dropping,<br>Calm’s gonna dry up too!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_0500_00_mma,,Nobody told me<br>Avalanche was in Calm!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_0600_00_mfa,,"The plate really fell, huh?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_0700_00_mfa,,Could Calm<br>have Avalanche collaborators too?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_0800_00_mfa,,Mako’s running low—<br>gotta start conserving now!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_0900_00_mfa,,"Shinra’s<br>capable of some scary stuff, huh?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_1000_00_mfa,,Saw some black cloaks<br>out in the Grasslands.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_2100_00_mma,,"The Mako stopped coming,<br>and the power just cut out!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_2110_00_mma,,Fix it already!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_2200_00_mma,,My fridge broke down too—<br>it’s creaking like crazy! What gives?!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_2300_00_mma,,Mako pipes busted?<br>When the hell are they fixing it?!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_2600_00_mfa,,"Hey, what’s going on?<br>We’re barely getting any Mako here!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_2700_00_mfa,,My washing machine’s dead—<br>do something about it!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_2800_00_mfa,,Hurry up and send some Mako already!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_3100_00_mma,,"Finally fixed, huh?<br>Back to normal life now."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_3200_00_mma,,Big thanks to the repair crew!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_3300_00_mma,,Hope this kinda thing<br>doesn’t happen again!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_3600_00_mfa,,It’s fixed now—<br>but I wish they’d done it faster!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_3700_00_mfa,,Gotta tackle all this piled-up laundry!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_3800_00_mfa,,"Phew, the Mako’s<br>finally flowing again!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_4100_00_mfa,,"Shinra’s new president is the old President’s son,<br>Rufus Shinra, right?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_4200_00_mfa,,He’s still young—<br>can he handle running a huge company?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_4300_00_mfa,,"He’s young and hot,<br>so he’ll be fine!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_4400_00_mfa,,Though you don’t run a business with your face.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_5100_00_mma,,Avalanche was right here in town—<br>how’d I not notice?!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_5200_00_mma,,"Next time they show up,<br>we’ll take ‘em down ourselves!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_5210_00_mma,,Protecting the reactor’s<br>part of the Reactor Patrol’s job!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_5900_00_mma,,"Held out through Shinra’s interrogations and waited—<br>something good’s gotta come my way, right?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_6000_00_mfa,,Look over there—<br>they’re practicing the harvest festival dance!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_6100_00_mfa,,"If I were a bit younger,<br>I’d join in too!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_6200_00_mma,,"Oh, it’s that time already?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_6210_00_mma,,"Can’t do the wild dances anymore,<br>but we could sway together nice and slow, huh?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_6300_00_mfa,,"Hehe, how many years has it been since I danced?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_6310_00_mfa,,Not since we met<br>at that Wall Market shop way back when.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7200_00_mmk,,Vroom vroom!<br>Airships are so cool!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7300_00_mmk,,"Hiyah! Parachute squad, reporting in!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7400_00_mmk,,I wanna ride a real one someday!<br>Gonna join Shinra’s army when I grow up!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7500_00_mmk,,"Yeah, I’ll<br>take down the Burke guys!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7600_00_mfa,,"Ugh, Shinra showing up<br>always makes me nervous."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7610_00_mfa,,Feels like we’re being watched—gross!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7700_00_mma,,"Yeah, those soldier helmets<br>make me tense up even when I’m innocent!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7800_00_mfa,,But what if<br>there’s a hot guy under that helmet?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7900_00_mma,,"Oh, that’d be a win~<br>Might even let him pat me down!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_0700_00_mfa,,"Been a while, huh?<br>Inviting me to lunch and all!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_0800_00_mfa,,"So, how much you need to borrow today?<br>Last time it was 300 gil."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_0900_00_mma,,Uh… maybe 500 gil?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_0910_00_mma,,That’d get me<br>that MooMoo-chan I’ve been eyeing!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_1000_00_mfa,,"You’re hopeless, honestly!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_2200_00_mmk,,Meow meow!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_2300_00_mfk,,"No, no! Yelling like that<br>will scare it away!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_2400_00_mmk,,"Here, some food~!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_2500_00_mfk,,That’s for the Chocobos!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_2900_00_mfa,,Reactors make the land barren!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_2910_00_mfa,,Calm’s nature stays safe<br>’cause we don’t have a reactor!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_3000_00_mfa,,"Ugh, here comes another lecture!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_3100_00_mfa,,Maybe I should join Avalanche!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_3200_00_mfa,,Every little action saves the planet—<br>gets me fired up!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_3300_00_mfa,,"Oh, come on!<br>Mako’s already giving us a peaceful life—<br>isn’t that enough?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_3400_00_mma,,That guy’s no good—how about this one?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_3500_00_mma,,"Hmm, doesn’t look like he’s got cash."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_3800_00_mma,,Listen up—<br>she gets off work at 7 p.m.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_3810_00_mma,,And her favorite drink’s<br>Land Pilsner.
